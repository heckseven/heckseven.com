sometimes you just want a static site with a little life to it without all the soul-sucking over-engineered package-blasting frameworks... and sometimes you also want all your stuff in text files that look good in a Git repo or like, any note app.

that's where 11ty comes in. [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) is a mostly-straightforward static site generator. it's also what i used to craft this site.

## some highlights

* pretty flippin fast
* keyboard nav doesn't suck
* looks great on w3m or lynx
* ascii headings (hidden for screen readers) and page titles (only for screen readers)
* per-document accent colors that apply to links, focus, selections, etc
* fancy images - IIRC, there is some optimization happening
* a little zine (probably better ways to do this, but hey it works)
