welcome to this living zine.
a mutable place to rest my thoughts.
expect issues to expand and evolve over time.
why should anything on this network remain unchanged?

this is my quiet rebellion.
i rebel against vendor lock-in by committing to directories of text files.
the ways of the old. the syntax of the young
i rebel against splintered social graphs.
their dopamine garden hoards pieces of me i will never recover.
i rebel against the framework fetishist AI blockchain apes.
electric vampires both literal and figurative, gifted unwavering verbal incontinence.
i rebel against the perfect AI slop of the world.
why are we so afraid to show the dirty side of the room?
i rebel against the death of the cascade.
and i do it with style ;)
